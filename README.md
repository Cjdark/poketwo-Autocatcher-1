# Pok√©viL SelfBot

>This specific selfbot was designed to automatically catch Pokemon spawned on Discord by PokeTwo bot. It also offers other utility functions to automate features like trading, releasing, ID search, etc. Apart from autocatching, the bot extends its features to more advanced version with better control.

**Pok√©viL now detects Gen 8 Pokemons as well!**

## Features ‚ú®
1. Solves Captcha (yes our Autocatcher solves captcha)
2. Automatically catch a Pokemon in whichever server you are in if the Poketwo bot spawns a Pokemon. 
3. Delay and catch rates to finesse the behaviour of the selfbot.
4. A log command to log all your Pokemon along with their numbers.
5. Priority List to control the Pokemon you catch and trade.
6. Blacklist and Whitelist channels to control the scope of the selfbot. And a toggler function for the switch.
7. Blacklist/Whitelist toggle for entire guilds.
8. Case-insensitive Commands. (Args are still sensitive.)
